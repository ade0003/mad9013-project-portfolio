### HTML
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

- There can only be one `h1` element per page and the `h1` must be unique on each page.
  - On the home page, the `h1` should be your name either in navbar or the main banner.
  - On the portfolio page there should be an `h1` of `My Portfolio` in the banner and the navbar name should be changed to a `strong`
  - On the contact page, `Contact Me` should be the `h1` and the navbar name should be changed to a `strong`

### CSS/TailwindCSS
Great work!

### Responsive Design
- The grid with border design you have gone with is cool and overall pretty effective. However, it makes it very obvious where there is a misalignment or variation to the design. Some examples:
  - The "Contact" button in the header does not line up with the right side of the rest of the containers
  - Inconsistent height of portfolio cards
  - The `input`/`textarea` border is much thinner and rounded, which feels out of place, you should apply a more similar treatment
- Instead of just using screenshots of your projects, try and find more engaging images that represent the project. The screenshots are cut off and poorly fit the space, so feel unprofessional.
- Make sure your are using up-to-date and accurate icons in the technology section!
  - The Ai and Ps logos do not reflect the current logos
- You should only apply hover/focus states to interactive elements to avoid confusing users. There is a hover on the `Contact Me` title but there is no interactive action.
- The Contact form feels too compressed on mobile. Consider using a 1 column layout and making it full width so there is not a double padding/border situation.

### Assignment Requirements
- Colour scheme in `tailwind.config.js` should have been changed from in-class colours
